transcript 0,"Sir, firstly congratulations on a good set of numbers. I just wanted to ask what is the current status on the capex you said that you are planning to invest Rs.800 Crores, by when would the facility be, how are you planning to fund it, what would be the equity component, what will be the debt component and are you looking for any fund raise from the market in terms of a QIP or a rights or any promoter infusion?

As far as the capex is concerned, we have acquired the land and the allotment has been made in our company’s name. We started initial process of leveling the land and the compound wall construction is in progress and the board is actually exploring various options to fund the project, in very short time we will be able to announce once the decision is made. The Board is exploring funding through equity but yet to firm up the decision and shortly we will come back on the various options once it is finalized."
transcript 1,"Okay, when you are expecting the factory to become up in running?

In about next ten months.

In ten months, the current financial year, right?

Yes. "
transcript 2,"Okay, my next question would be on the GCC model that is there, what exactly does it mean for us in terms of do we sell our buses outright to a third party who then services the GCC contract or how does that work, where I am coming from is the implication on Olectra Greentech’s working capital and whether as we get more and more GCC orders will our receivables balloon up?

You are right actually, gross cost contract involves basically three parties, Olectra Greentech Limited is the manufacturing arm which is the OEM. So, our business model is to manufacture and supply and sell the buses on an outright basis. The operating company is the company which buys buses from us and then operate on a per kilo meter basis to the end customer which is the state transport utilities. Currently under this FAME-2 and FAME-1 which followed the FAME-2 the Department of Heavy Industries is the nodal agency which is actually managing all the subsidy aspect. So, under this current scenario it is basically the STUs which are actually sourcing the buses on a GCC model. As far as Olectra is concerned we are not seeing a big concern on the receivable build up because we have a clear-cut arrangement with the operating company to make the payment to us and basically 75% of the cost of the bus we will receive on or before delivery and 25% we will receive over a period of 120 to 180 days.

Okay, 120 to 180 days that added to reasonable got it and I had a query our current order book is about 1500 odd buses, right?

That would translate to what in terms of Crores approximately about Rs.3000 Crores?

Actually, we have about 1398buses order on hand where we are planning to deliver about 1000 buses in the coming financial year, so 1000 buses based on the sales mix of 12 meter and 9 meters, on an average Rs.1500 Crores is what we can expect the topline.

Of which Rs.1.5 Crores is the rough you are looking at the current product mix, right?

Okay and this will be delivered in this year you are saying, 1000 buses of which you are looking at this year?

Yes, we are planning to deliver 1000 buses in coming financial year."
transcript 3,"Just my final question, the recent tender that was there of 5450 buses it means the TAMO was L1 across, by how much were we kind of higher and does this mean that we will not Olectra Greentech Limited May 04, 2022 Page 6 of 19 receive anything out of that or are we like a secondary bidder somewhere where we can a part of that bid?

At the outset basically the tender has been announced and the rates which have been quoted is very unrealistic and lower in the whole EV industry and until and unless the LOA is awarded we cannot conclude, because we were L1 in several orders but only when the LOA is awarded we can conclude that the order has been finalized and there are various tenders which are been quoted and not only the DHI related tenders which are floated there are several states coming up with their own tenders, with their own subsidy programs and with the market share we have and the performance and technology advantage we have and the first mover advantage we have we are confident of basically getting lot of orders from various states under the state subsidy programs. For example, in Pune Municipal Corporation which under this Smart City Program has ordered about 500 buses, similarly, we are expecting lot of tenders from other states as well.

Okay, understood Sir, but in this CESL-1 of 5400 odd buses there we have not got anything L1, right?

We are not L1 in 5450 buses, yes."
transcript 4,"Sir, couple of questions, one is there has been a substantial reduction in working capital in FY2022, so what is next to that and how much of this is sustainable?

Last year all of us are aware the entire country and the world actually got impacted by COVID pandemic situation which has led to a buildup of receivables and basically all these state transport utilities also have not cleared the delivery of the buses. Now, our operating company has got financial sanctions in almost all the projects and all the operations are now running on to full capacity from last October. That has led to the realisation of the receivables and we hope the trend will continue in the near term as well as future years to come.

Okay, got it. My second question pertains to the cost inflation which we are seeing in the battery prices given the inflation then food price. So, what is the cost inflation we are seeing for the battery prices so far?

Basically, the component of battery is about 25 – 30% of the total sales price of the bus. We understand from our technology partners that LFP battery prices have been decreasing YOY during the last several years, however due to the recent COVID situation and the current Ukraine–Russia war has led to increase in raw material prices for the LFP batteries. However, based on discussion with our technology partner, we understand that these prices are expected to be normalized by the end of this financial year. As far as we are concerned there is a sufficient inventory which has protected for whatever increase or slight increase in the battery costs are concerned, that is one aspect and second is on Olectra it does not impact so much on the final sale price of the bus

Okay, and we largely use electric batteries and not NMC as much? The battery technology which use is LFP or NMC?

Yes, you are right LFP."
transcript 5,"lastly with respect to the PLI scheme incentive which were awarded Olectra was in the part of that past two years, so how do we continue to compete in the markets where some of our peers would have between 11 to 18% incentive under this scheme. Are you seeing some impact of that already in this tender where Tata Motors was L1 bidder who would have bid based that incentive?

Prices at which the bidding was done is definitely not sustainable for any OEM this has been very aggressive and as far as we are concerned, except for the battery and battery management system, we have localized our manufacturing in India, so we are definitely seeing cost reduction, because our base of next six to twelve months’ time except the battery and battery management system everything is localized and we have a robust R&D team, we have been working on various variants and introducing new products and not only that we are focusing on the untapped markets like the private and the intercity operations and the last mile connectivity product which is 7 meters. By introducing the new products and then exploring the new untapped market in overall scheme of things we are well placed."
transcript 6,"Okay, great and lastly any update on the electric LCV planning to launch any further update on that, would we expect to timeline?

Basically, we are proud to announce we have just started the trials of our electric truck in the month of April and shortly after completion of trials in the next few months we are likely to launch for commercial operations.

This would be in what truck segment?

This is the trucks and tipper, so this will be a game changer as far as the market is concerned because we are the first company to have introduced electric truck."
transcript 7,"the company has the capacity of making 1000 buses and order book of around 1400 buses but only less than 300 buses were delivered in the last financial year what is the reason?

Initially you are aware it was COVID related issues and if you see the first half we have delivered only about 29 buses from 29 buses we have delivered roughly 230 plus buses in the second half and we hope that the numbers will be better than Q3 and Q4."
transcript 8,"Ritwik this side, congratulations for the stellar performance of Olectra Greentech. My question is that, any plans of selling the insulator business to focus on the electric vehicle business and secondly Sir, I have seen an organization as a part of corporate governance Olectra Greentech Limited May 04, 2022 Page 10 of 19 every organization have a group they actually plan fund to protect the interest of the employees, so these are my question.

Coming to the first question, as of now there are no intensions to divest insulator business and insulator business as such is a cash cow it sustains on its own, so there are no such plans as of now. Second is regarding gratuity it is not funded as of now we follow the actuarial method as per accounting standards we make adequate provision. As of now it is not funded we will explore in future.

Okay Sir, one more thing is that PMI Photon is another player which is coming up, how do you see PMI Photon as far as rates are concerned, because PMI Photon is again a Chinese player, any thoughts on that?

This is Hanuman. PMI Photon is there for the last two-three years, they are one of the competitors with Olectra since long, and we are not seeing any new competition in that perspective.

To add to that there is scope for the electric industry’s nascent and there is a large, large opportunity for many players to come in. There is scope for everyone to come in, to have their own pie we do not see a threat from PMI though it is one of the emerging players.

Not only PMI many new players are coming but one thing we have to see market is growing like anything, right now CESL tendered for 5000 buses, price discovery done, even though they are yet to come, CESL announced for another 10,000 buses likewise market is growing even though these new players are coming forward we do not see any threat to Olectra rather we would say it is good for the industry and Country.

"
transcript 9,"Okay and how do you look at the bottomline going forward as Mr. KV. Pradeep mentioned in one of the new channels that your bottomline will grow year-on-year by at least 10% spanning the profitability?

On an overall volume we expect EBITDA to be in the region of 10 to 12%.

Quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year?

Quarter-on-quarter to year-on-year we expect the margins to be in the range of around 10 to 12%."
transcript 10,"Good evening, Sir. Heartiest congratulations for a wonderful set of numbers and performance. I have also been an active shareholder of yours for the long time. Sir, just three questions and probably I will take them one-by-one. Firstly, what support do you get from the government with respect to finally payment of your sale to subsidy, if you can answer this then I will go to the next question.

As far as the subsidy is concerned, the subsidy is managed by the operating company which owns the bus but to give a clarity of the subsidy how it works, the government of India through DHI give 20% of the subsidy amount at the time of signing the agreement and 40% of the subsidy amount is released on delivery of the bus and the balance 40% of the amount is delivered after six months of operational performance of the bus. The subsidy is in the region of Rs.45 lakhs to Rs.55 Lakhs depending on the model."
transcript 11,"Ritwik this side, congratulations for the stellar performance of Olectra Greentech. My question is that, any plans of selling the insulator business to focus on the electric vehicle business and secondly Sir, I have seen an organization as a part of corporate governance Olectra Greentech Limited May 04, 2022 Page 10 of 19 every organization have a group they actually plan fund to protect the interest of the employees, so these are my question.

Second is regarding gratuity it is not funded as of now we follow the actuarial method as per accounting standards we make adequate provision. As of now it is not funded we will explore in future."
transcript 12,"Good evening, Sir thank you for the opportunity. Congratulations on good numbers. Couple of questions from my end, firstly company has been participating in multiple tender and possibly CESL will come out with more tenders for other cities, recently media reports have been indicating another 10,000 bus tenders are on the anvil. What is the opportunity size which you are looking for in the near term? My second question is what is the sustainable ROE’s which the company is targeting over the medium-term currently it is in single digits?

Coming to the second question, our return on networth is about 5% and definitely there is an improvement because the volumes started picking up from Q3 onwards. Going forward we are expecting consistent delivery of buses once we have consistent delivery definitely the ROCE and ROE will improve and coming back to your first question on CESL tender it is not concluded yet and definitely we are expecting reasonably good orders in the coming 10,000 numbers. Olectra Greentech Limited May 04, 2022 Page 13 of 19

Not only from CESL so many other states are coming forward aggressively, so CESL is the one for the price discovery of 10000 buses recently they announced and they are yet to come. Other states like BEST Pune and so many other states have already floated and which are in the process and definitely we are sure and confident that we will have good number of orders.

Thank you, Sir. Wishing you all the best there. Just one more query from my end, in terms of the dynamics and the profitability how would three-wheeler business be different from that of the buses?

Significantly different in terms of technology and all and it is more of a volume driven in the huge volume, it will be more of a topline and not on bottomline, we do not expect significant margin."
transcript 13,"We have bid for certain buses in GCC as a part of our SPV where we are part of a SPV as and when we as a part of the consortium as well in that case Olectra is selling outright to the SPV but how is the SPV funding those buses, do they have any banking arrangements or how do they go about that?

To give clarity one third of the cost of the bus they get subsidy.

But as you mentioned earlier on that comes in three installments, right?

Correct, and out of two-third, one-third will be debt and one-third will be equity and they have financial closures in almost all the projects.

Okay, so two-third is debt funded there.

Two-third is debt and equity by the parent company.

Okay two-third is debt and equity and one-third is subsidy? 

We participated through a consortium which is the three-wheeler manufacturing company and we got about 13650 numbers of three-wheelers wherein Olectra will have about 50% share. Again, the cities and the number allocation are still in the progress. Very shortly it will be finalized and it will definitely add to our top line growth. As I mentioned margins basically to start with, we may not get great margins. "
transcript 14,"Sure, and Sir what about the batteries for these three wheelers, where does that come from a technology standpoint?

It is actually we have consortium tie up with already manufacturing company. Not much of great technology like what is there for buses with that of three wheelers. It is locally procured.

Okay, it is a local company from Hyderabad, is it Sir?

"
transcript 15,"Okay, great Sir like I said just lastly if you can clarify on the first question I asked, if you can give us some numbers in terms of number of buses that you expect, I am not going to hold against it, just to get an idea of what kind of numbers internally you guys are budgeting to reach out to this capacity for the bus business, for the electric bus business exclusively. Like you said it can be 20000-30000 orders, the potential size or if you give me some size and give me some market share to some extent, I can get some numbers in my head, I guess?

Basically, we cannot give any guidelines but what we can say is this year we did about 259 buses, from 259 buses we are going to definitely go up to 1000 buses we are planning and then it is going to substantially increase from there."
transcript 16,"Sir, I have a couple of question, first one is we are talking of delivering 1000 buses this year, this is out of 1380 buses order which we have, are we not assuming some new orders to come in this year which will be delivered during the course of the year?

It is quite possible."
transcript 17,"Thank you for the opportunity. I primarily have two questions, number one being you have announced that you fixed planned and you also mentioned with the board who decide the way of funding, so internally when can we expect financial closure for something of this size considering it is such a large capex, number one. Number two, you mentioned that you are going to be delivering about 70-80% of your order book this year itself and you are doing a large capex of 10,000 buses if I am not wrong. So, over the next year, year and a half, two years when your capex is going to be ready where do you see this demand coming from, because you are clearly very, very bullish on the tipper business also or up, so if you can through some light a) on the tenders that you are looking forward to even though there is 10,000 bus order, what other as you mentioned a couple of times in the call that a lot of other states that are wanting to give out tenders. What is the kind of inflow that one may expect for the bus business and if you can through a little lighter on the tipper business in terms of, I understand you cannot talk about the technology part but what is the kind of volumes that you could do and where can these volumes be generated from? Thank you.

Your first question was on the funding; I think very shortly in four to eight weeks’ time we will be basically finalizing on the fund-raising plan and definitely we will come back to the investors. The second is the capacity what we are planning to build is to start with we will have a capacity of about 5000 buses/trucks and tippers which will be expanded to 10,000 buses/trucks and tippers. As far as the market for trucks and tippers are concerned it is quite huge and these tippers are used in mining, irrigation, and construction sites. As you are aware our promoter also is a very large company in terms of mining, irrigation, and construction projects if you see there is a lot of opportunities in house itself wherein we could replace the conventional ICE trucks and tippers with electric tippers and trucks. There is a huge opportunity for us and this will be an outright model unlike GCC in case of electric buses.

How are these tippers going to be priced at versus ICE engine tippers?

As of now it is not yet finalized.

Even if you give us a brief idea in terms of percentage, is it going to be 50% higher?

As of now it is too early actually because we have just started the trials, once the commercial trials are completed, once we do the commercial launch, we will start selling trucks/tippers, as of now we do not have any number."
transcript 18,"Sure, and you mentioned about MEIL having a large population of tippers which can be replaced through Olectra itself, what number can that be if you can give us some sense. The reason I am asking you this question is because I want to understand building a capacity of this size and how much it is actually going to be catered to for the tipper business because like I said it seems like you are extremely bullish on that part of the business also and I understand the bus business depends a lot on what tenders you bid for what tenders come out and if the tipper business is not the GCC model it is an outright OEM business it can be extremely profitable and easy to turnaround so, what is the kind of number that someone can expect, I do not mean in a short-term basis and even once you announced and what kind of economics can it generate our business like Olectra, that is what I am trying to get in, Sir?

It is complimentary tippers and trucks in terms of complexity much lesser than buses and it is an outright sale and we expect actually these are very, very tentative numbers anywhere between 500 and 1000 to start with.

This will be first year of operation is what you are saying?

Okay, and this turning around in terms of production is similar to a bus, is that fair to assume?

Yes, it is complimentary that is the reason it is much less complex."
transcript 19,"Sir there is also three-wheeler electric theme that Olectra has got into if I read that correctly, if you can through some light on that if there are any tenders like you have bid for one and how will it be manufacture, if you can through some light there it could be helpful to us?

We participated through a consortium which is the three-wheeler manufacturing company and we got about 13650 numbers of three-wheelers wherein Olectra will have about 50% share. Again, the cities and the number allocation are still in the progress. Very shortly it will be finalized and it will definitely add to our top line growth. As I mentioned margins basically to start with, we may not get great margins. 

It is actually we have consortium tie up with already manufacturing company. Not much of great technology like what is there for buses with that of three wheelers."
